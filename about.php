            Welcome to CodeX Forum, your number one source for all your Queries. We're dedicated to providing you with the very best solutions, with an emphasis on explanation, facts, and procedure. Founded in 2022 by Ayush, CodeX Forum has come a long way from its
            beginnings in India. When our founder first started out, his passion for solutions to coding problems via peer-to-peer applicants drove him to start his own business.<br />

            <br />We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br />

            <br />Sincerely,<br /> Ayush Kumar<br />
